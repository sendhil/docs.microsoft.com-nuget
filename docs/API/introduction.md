# NuGet API Introduction

There are a variety of ways to interact with NuGet programmatically.

## Consuming and publishing packages

The following methods allow you to interact with packages available on nuget.org and other V3-enabled NuGet package sources such as MyGet and Visual Studio Team Services package management:

1. Use the [HTTP-based V3 API](v3/overview.md) and write your own client code.
1. Use the [NuGet client SDK](nuget-client-sdk.md), a set of .NET libraries used by the official NuGet clients.

When interacting with [nuget.org's HTTP protocol](nuget-protocols.md), there are additional requirements and endpoints
available on top of the documented V3 API.

## Extending authentication

NuGet supports extensions on how users authenticate with packages sources via **credential providers**. There are two
forms of credential providers each used by a different client experience.

1. [Credential providers for Visual Studio](NuGet-Credential-Providers-for-Visual-Studio.md).
1. [Credential providers for nuget.exe](nuget-exe-Credential-Providers.md).
