# Search

It is possible to search for packages available on a package source using the V3 API. The resource used for searching
is the `SearchQueryService` resource found in the [service index](service-index.md).

## Versioning

There are three resource `@type` values for searching. All three values represent the exact same API surface area. Note
that non-breaking changes (defined as added JSON properties or query parameters) are periodically added and documented
here.

The `@type` values are:

 - `SearchQueryService`
 - `SearchQueryService/3.0.0-beta`
 - `SearchQueryService/3.0.0-rc`

### API changes

 - August 2017: Added the `verified` property to the search result.
 - March 2017: Added a `semVerLevel` query parameter which defaults to filtering out SemVer 2.0.0 packages.

## Base URL

The base URL for the following API is the value of the `@id` property associated with one of the aforementioned
resource `@type` values. In the following document, this placeholder URL will be used:

```
https://example/query
```

## HTTP methods

All URLs found in the search resource only support the HTTP method `GET`.

## Search for packages

The search API allows a client to query for a page of packages matching a specified search query. The interpretation
of the search query (e.g. the tokenization of the search terms) is determined by the server implementation but the
general expectation is that the search query is used for matching package IDs, titles, descriptions, and tags. Other
package metadata fields may also be considered.

An unlisted package should never appear in search results.

```
GET https://example/query?q={QUERY}&skip={SKIP}&take={TAKE}&prerelease={PRERELEASE}&semVerLevel={SEMVERLEVEL}
```

### Request parameters

Name        | In     | Type    | Required | Notes
----------- | ------ | ------- | -------- | -----
q           | URL    | string  | no       | The search terms to used to filter packages
skip        | URL    | integer | no       | The number of results to skip, for pagination
take        | URL    | integer | no       | The number of results to return, for pagination
prerelease  | URL    | boolean | no       | `true` or `false` determining whether to include [pre-release packages](../../create-packages/prerelease-packages.md)
semVerLevel | URL    | string  | no       | A SemVer 2.0.0 version string 

The search query `q` is parsed in a manner that is defined by the server implementation. nuget.org supports basic
filtering on a [variety of fields](../../consume-packages/finding-and-choosing-packages.md#search-syntax). If no
`q` is provided, all packages should be returned. This enables the "Browse" tab in the NuGet Visual Studio
experience.

The `skip` parameter defaults to 0.

The `take` parameter should be an integer greater than zero. The server implementation may impose a maximum value.

If `prerelease` is not provided, pre-release packages are excluded.

The `semVerLevel` query parameter is used to opt-in to SemVer 2.0.0 packages. If this query parameter is excluded, only
SemVer 1.0.0 compatible packages will be returned. If `semVerLevel=2.0.0` is provided, both SemVer 1.0.0 and SemVer 2.0.0
compatible packages will be returned. See the [SemVer 2.0.0 protocol](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Semver-2.0.0-Protocol)
for more information.

### Response

The response is JSON document containing up to `take` search results. Search results are grouped by package ID.

Search results returned by nuget.org looks something like this, when using `q=NuGet.Versioning&prerelease=false`:

[!code-JSON [search-result.json](./_data/search-result.json)]

The root JSON object has the following properties:

Name      | Type             | Required | Notes
--------- | ---------------- | -------- | -----
totalHits | integer          | yes      | The total number of matches, disregarding `skip` and `take`
data      | array of objects | yes      | The search results matched by the request

### Search result

Each item in the `data` array is a JSON object comprised of a group of package versions sharing the same package ID.
The object has the following properties:

Name           | Type                       | Required | Notes
-------------- | -------------------------- | -------- | -----
id             | string                     | yes      | The ID of the matched package
version        | string                     | yes      | The full SemVer 2.0.0 version string of the package (could contain build metadata)
description    | string                     | no       | 
versions       | array of objects           | yes      | All of the versions of the package matching the `prerelease` parameter
authors        | string or array of strings | no       | 
iconUrl        | string                     | no       | 
licenseUrl     | string                     | no       | 
owners         | string or array of strings | no       | 
projectUrl     | string                     | no       | 
registration   | string                     | no       | The absolute URL to the associated [registration index](registration-base-url-resource.md#registration-index)
summary        | string                     | no       | 
tags           | string or array of strings | no       | 
title          | string                     | no       | 
totalDownloads | integer                    | no       | This value can be inferred by the sum of downloads in the `versions` array
verified       | boolean                    | no       | A JSON boolean indicating whether the package is [verified](../../reference/id-prefix-reservation.md)

On nuget.org, a verified package is one which has a package ID matching a reserved ID prefix and that package owned by
one of the reserved namespace's owners. For more information, see the
[documentation about ID prefix reservation](../../reference/id-prefix-reservation.md).

The metadata contained in the search result object is taken from the latest package version. Each item in the
`versions` array is a JSON object with the following properties:

Name      | Type    | Required | Notes
--------- | ------- | -------- | -----
@id       | string  | yes      | The absolute URL to the associated [registration leaf](registration-base-url-resource.md#registration-leaf)
version   | string  | yes      | The full SemVer 2.0.0 version string of the package (could contain build metadata)
downloads | integer | yes      | The number of downloads for this specific package version
